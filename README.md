A JK flip-flop is a fundamental building block of digital circuits, used in digital electronics and sequential logic circuits. It is a type of bistable multivibrator, meaning it has two stable states and can store one bit of information.

JK flip-flops are versatile and widely used in digital design due to their ability to store data and perform various logic operations. They are foundational components in the construction of more complex digital systems.
